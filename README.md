## Projects

### [1. West Nile Virus incidence rate prediction across US] (https://github.com/ncsa/CPRHD_WNV_GI)
- Performed data cleaning using Python scripts and OpenRefine on large scale-multi dimensional datasets and prepared it for predictive modeling
- Validated data, conducted exploratory analysis and understood the outliers in the data and the relationship between various Socio-economic contributing to the outbreak of the virus and the incidence rate
- Created visualization dashboard using bokeh and plotly packages to understand the effect of different variables
- Implemented Vector Auto-Regression model for Data imputation of Socio-economic features for required years
- Built Random Forest, LSTM, Zero Inflated Poisson regression model to forecast the outbreak pattern of virus

### [2. Predicting mortality by Acute Lower Respiratory Diseases in Americas] (https://github.com/vpb2/PracticalHealthData)
- Implemented python scripts for Data Cleaning and Wrangling on datasets from WHO and data world
- Created Auto-ARIMA model to check the time-series validity of the indicators
- Built Vector Autoregression model to perform Multivariate Time Series forecasting and predicted the death count for countries in the American continent for the year 2020

### [3. Oscar predictions] (https://github.com/vpb2/Machine_Learning_Oscars)
- Aggregated data from multiple sources by web scraping and cleaned the data using OpenRefine
- Performed exploratory analysis to verify expected relationships, identify patterns and outliers
- Implemented Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees and Random Forests algorithms to compare different models and to achieve an accuracy of 90% in predictions using sklearn package

### [4. Monte Carlo Simulation of Air Ambulance Requirements] (https://github.com/vpb2/IS590PR-Simulation_of_Air_Ambulance_Requirements)
- Implemented python scripts to perform Monte Carlo Simulation on self-generated Helicopter data and generate the optimal Helicopter as result
- An appropriate helicopter is selected to perform the rescue operation based on calculated least rescue time
